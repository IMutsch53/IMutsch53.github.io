<h2>Golfing</h2>
<p>I don't play many sports consistently except for golf. I picked it up during my freshman year of high school with no experience. I started pretty badly, but I have gotten a lot better. I'll go out on the course by 
myself if I'm aiming to improve, but I prefer to play with a couple of friends.<br> I am yet to join any leagues or clubs but I hope to in the near future.</p>
<h2>Video Games</h2>
<p>I started playing video games when I was around five or six years old. My siblings and I bonded over long gaming sessions on the PlayStation 2, and later the PlayStation 3, with titles like Call of Duty and Minecraft. 
  I don’t stick to a single genre—I enjoy a wide variety of games. The ones I play most often include first-person shooters, survival games, RPGs, adventure, simulation, strategy, and indie games.
  <br>If I had to pick my top three favorites, they would be Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Ghost of Tsushima, and The Last of Us. I loved the intense, skill-based combat in Sekiro and had to come back to it multiple times 
  before finally beating it—after which I played through it five more times to unlock all the achievements. Ghost of Tsushima stood out for its beautiful visuals, fluid combat, and compelling storytelling. I hold The 
  Last of Us in high regard not only for its incredible narrative, but also for the nostalgia—it reminds me of watching my brother play through it when I was younger. <br>
  These days, my gaming rotation includes Valorant, Rocket League, and Apex Legends, though I like to mix things up with new or random games to keep things fresh.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Reading is a recent hobby I picked up from my sister, my dad, and one of my friends from home. For a long time, I didn't think I would enjoy reading and couldn't find a book that could keep me engaged. I started reading
after the summer of 2024 as another hobby when I couldn't golf or got bored with playing video games. The first series author that got me into the hobby was Brandon Sanderson. I was recommended to him by my friend from home, 
and picked up his book <i>Elantris</i> and his series <i>Mistborn</i>. I thoroughly enjoyed reading these, and it kick-started my enjoyment of reading. Some books I have on my "to-read" list are <i>The Shadow of the Gods</i>
by John Gwynne, <i>The Way of Kings</i> by Brandon Sanderson, and <i>The Strength of the Few</i> by James Islington, which is set to come out later this year.
