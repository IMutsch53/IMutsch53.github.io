I am currently a sophomore at Southern Illinois University, pursuing a major in Computer Science. I graduated from Rushville-Industry High School, where I developed my passion for programming after taking a Python course. My teacher noted that I might have an aptitude for the subject, which inspired me to further explore the field and ultimately pursue a career as a Software Engineer.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have been employed at Dairy Queen for four years and currently hold a shift leader position. This role has helped me develop valuable leadership and team management skills while providing exceptional customer service.

Outside of work and studies, I enjoy reading, playing video games, staying active through occasional sports, and listening to music. I am eager to continue developing my skills in software development and look forward to contributing to the tech industry in the near future.
